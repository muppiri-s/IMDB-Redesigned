# IMDB Redesigned Project

This project focuses on the redesign of the IMDb website, with a strong emphasis on improving user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design. The redesign process involved applying principles from "Don't Make Me Think" and Nielsen's 10 Heuristic Principles, as well as conducting usability testing. The project includes wireframes, high-fidelity and low-fidelity UI designs, responsive web designs created in Adobe Illustrator, and interactive prototypes developed in Figma.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to enhance the IMDb website's usability and aesthetics by applying principles of effective UI/UX design. Here's a brief overview of the project components:

- **Evaluation:** The existing IMDb website was assessed using Nielsen's 10 Heuristic Principles and insights from the book "Don't Make Me Think." This evaluation served as a foundation for identifying usability issues and improvement opportunities.

- **Usability Testing:** Usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from users and further understand pain points and areas for improvement.

- **Design Iteration:** The website was redesigned with a focus on creating wireframes, low-fidelity and high-fidelity UIs, and responsive web designs using Adobe Illustrator. The designs aim to address the identified usability issues and enhance the overall user experience.

## Design Process

1. **Evaluation:** The initial phase involved a thorough evaluation of the existing IMDb website, identifying areas of improvement, and understanding user pain points.

2. **Usability Testing:** User testing sessions were conducted to validate the findings from the evaluation and gather direct feedback from users.

3. **Wireframing:** Wireframes were created to visualize the proposed changes to the website's layout and functionality.

4. **UI Design:** Low-fidelity and high-fidelity user interface designs were developed, incorporating the feedback from usability testing and wireframing.

5. **Responsive Design:** Responsive web designs were crafted to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

6. **Interactive Prototypes:** Interactive prototypes were created in Figma to provide a tangible experience of the redesigned website.
